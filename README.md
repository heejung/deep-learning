## Deep Learning

### 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns (Neural Networks)
Build and train a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

### 2. Dog-Breed Classifier (CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks)
Build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my CNN identifies an estimate of the canine's breed.

### 3. Generate TV Script (RNN & LSTM)
Generate a TV script by defining and training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), such as Long-term Short-term Memory (LSTM)

### 4. Generate Faces (GAN - Generative Adversarial Networks)
Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them until you can generate realistic faces.

### 5. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model (deploy on SageMaker)
Build and deploy a neural network which predicts the senstiment of a user-provided movie review. In addition, create a simple web app that uses the deployed model. 

## Computer Vision

### 1. Facial Keypoint Detection (CNN to detect facial keypoints)
Apply my knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoint (eyes, mouth, nose, etc) detection.

### 2. Image Captioning (CNN Encoder/RNN Decoder)
Train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image by implementing an effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder.

### 3. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding environment, using elements of probability, motion models, andl inear algebra.
