# deep-learning
Deep Learning applications, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing/Understanding applications. Projects are suggested by Udacity (udacity.com).

## Deep Learning

### 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Build and train a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Computer Vision

### 1. Facial Keypoint Detection (CNN to detect facial keypoints)
Apply my knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoint (eyes, mouth, nose, etc) detection.

### 2. Image Captioning (CNN Encoder/RNN Decoder)
Train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image by implementing an effective RNN decoder for a CNN encoder.

### 3. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding environment, using elements of probability, motion models, andl inear algebra.
